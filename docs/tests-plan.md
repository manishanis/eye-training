# Test Plan for Game Application

This document outlines the test plan for the game application using Playwright. The tests are organized by feature and component, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the application's functionality.

## 1. Setup and Configuration

- **Verify Environment Setup:**
  - Ensure Playwright is installed and configured correctly.
  - Verify that the application can be launched in a test environment.

## 2. Core Game Functionality

### 2.1 Game Start and Initialization

- **Test Game Start:**
  - Verify that the game starts correctly when the start button is clicked.
  - Ensure the initial game state is set to 'playing' or 'warmup'.

- **Test Initial State:**
  - Check that the initial score is zero.
  - Verify that the first round is generated with a target and options.

### 2.2 Option Selection

- **Test Option Selection:**
  - Verify that clicking an option triggers the selection process.
  - Ensure correct options increase the score and generate a new round.
  - Check that incorrect options trigger negative feedback.

- **Test Option Randomization:**
  - Ensure options are shuffled and the correct option is not always in the same position.

### 2.3 Pause and Resume

- **Test Pause Functionality:**
  - Verify that clicking the pause button pauses the game.
  - Ensure the game state changes to 'paused' and option selection is disabled.

- **Test Resume Functionality:**
  - Verify that clicking the resume button resumes the game.
  - Ensure the game state returns to 'playing' or 'warmup'.

## 3. UI and Visual Feedback

### 3.1 Visual Feedback on Selection

- **Test Correct Option Feedback:**
  - Verify that selecting the correct option provides positive visual feedback.

- **Test Incorrect Option Feedback:**
  - Verify that selecting an incorrect option provides negative visual feedback.

### 3.2 Responsive Design

- **Test Responsiveness:**
  - Verify that the application layout adjusts correctly on different screen sizes.

## 4. Background and Animation

### 4.1 Background Dots

- **Test Background Dots Movement:**
  - Verify that background dots move as expected.
  - Ensure dots pause when the game is paused and resume when the game is resumed.

## 5. Edge Cases and Error Handling

- **Test Invalid States:**
  - Verify that the application handles invalid game states gracefully.
  - Ensure no options are selectable when the game is not in 'playing' or 'warmup' state.

- **Test Timer and Interval Handling:**
  - Verify that timers and intervals are cleared and reset correctly during game state changes.

## 6. Final Checks

- **Test Game Over State:**
  - Verify that the game transitions to 'gameOver' state correctly.
  - Ensure all relevant UI elements update accordingly.

- **Test Reset Functionality:**
  - Verify that the game can be reset and started anew without issues.

This test plan provides a comprehensive approach to testing the game application, ensuring all critical functionalities are covered. Adjust and expand the tests as needed based on further development and feature additions.
